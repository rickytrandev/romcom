### Installation Instructions:
1. fork this boilerplate repository 
2. Clone down your new, forked repo
3. cd into the repository
4. Open it in your text editor

### Context:
During week 2 of our journey with Turing, We were given 5 days to complete the project.

### Learning Goals:
Our main learning goal was to explore the power of DOM to query the buttons - allowing the user to show and hide views, add and delete covers from our data model, render the list of favorited covers from our data model, and allow the user to create their own cover with their input values.  

Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

### Wins + Challenges:
We were particularly challenged with creating the logic to capture our event's properties to store into our data model in order to render them in our favorites section. We were also challenged with creating the logic to delete these covers from our data model. Our challengers were our wins!
